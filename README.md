###Since the website has chenged the web scraper is not working anymore, the data are now available in the coronawarn app
# covid Erlangen API

This script takes the data from the same API as the Erlangen website and dysplay hystorical data about covid in the Erlangen council.

I do not guarantee the accuracy of the data provided or that this script will keep working in the future since it depends on the API

### Work in progress:
- add simpler installation and/or running on pc without python or without the needed modules?
- add more data?
- add a comparison with the rest of Germany?
- add a batch file
